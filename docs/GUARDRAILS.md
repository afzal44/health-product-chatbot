# Guardrails Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the guardrails implementation for the health-product-chatbot project. Guardrails are essential for ensuring that the application operates within defined parameters, maintaining both functionality and security.

## Purpose of Guardrails
Guardrails serve to:
- Prevent misuse of the application.
- Ensure compliance with business rules and regulations.
- Enhance user experience by guiding interactions.

## Implementation Details
The guardrails are implemented in the `src/shared/guardrails.py` file. This module contains the logic that enforces the rules and constraints necessary for the chatbot's operation.

### Key Features
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that all user inputs are validated against predefined criteria.
- **Rate Limiting**: Controls the frequency of requests to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
- **Error Handling**: Provides mechanisms to handle errors gracefully, ensuring that users receive informative feedback.

## Configuration
The guardrails can be configured through the `src/config/guardrails_config.json` file. This JSON file allows for easy adjustments to the parameters governing the guardrails' behavior.

### Example Configuration
```json
{
    "max_input_length": 200,
    "rate_limit": {
        "requests_per_minute": 60
    },
    "error_messages": {
        "input_too_long": "Your input exceeds the maximum allowed length.",
        "rate_limit_exceeded": "You are sending requests too quickly. Please slow down."
    }
}
```

## Usage
To utilize the guardrails in your application, ensure that the `guardrails.py` module is imported in the relevant parts of your codebase. The guardrails will automatically enforce the defined rules during user interactions.

## Conclusion
Implementing guardrails is crucial for maintaining the integrity and usability of the health-product-chatbot. By adhering to the guidelines outlined in this document, developers can ensure a robust and user-friendly application.
